# :cloud: Weather Journal App
The project's goal was to create an asynchronous web app that uses API and user data to dynamically update the UI. I also used nodemon to reload my server automatically for when I made any changes to my project.
Weather app using Open Weather Map api and display dynamic data and dynamic icon that will change based on weather on weather condition.



## Dependencies

- You also need to install `cors` separately, use `npm i cors`
- To install nodemon, `npm install -g nodemon`
- To start your project run `npm devStart`
